    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll take an opportunity to explore the data we'll be using.\n",
    "Data exploration and understanding is a fundamental step in Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, the data we'll be looking at is the MNIST data set. It consists of 60,000 examples of handwritten digits, with a label corresponding to what the intended digit is. It's worth mentioning that in ML, 60,000 examples is considered a fairly small dataset. Creating an AI to label handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset is a very common, almost \"hello world\" style of AI program\n",
    "\n",
    "It's helpful to know a few characteristics about the dataset in this course in particular. Specifically how it's laid out. In the MNIST dataset we have provided we have done some preprocessing of the data. The data you'll be provided is in CSV format, with the first element corresponding to the actual value, and the rest of the elements corresponding to a 28x28 pixel image of the digit. That 28x28 pixels is flattened in the dataset into 784 individual pixel elements. Each pixel element is in the range of \\[0,255\\] which corresponds to a greyscale. In the case of a color image, each element might be a triple which would correspond to an (R,G,B) value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset will be used to train the model to recognize the relationship between the pixel values of the 28x28 image, and the digit that we tell the model that the pixel values correspond to. The goal of the neural network that you develop over the course of this lab will be to take in an image of a digit, and correctly classify it by outputting the correct digit. No neural network is going to be perfect, but we hope to achieve high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy in this lab is defined specifically as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $ Accuracy = {Correct\\_Predictions \\over Total\\_Predictions} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this metric isn't always the optimal metric for every situation, and some ML systems will need different metrics, but for the purposes of this course, it will work well enough\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, we'll really understand what our data looks like, and that will help us when constructing the AI in the future notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's load the data"
